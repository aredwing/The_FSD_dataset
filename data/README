The Flintstones Scene Dataset instructions

1. Video files of the raw scenes are availabel in [this Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bG8Iirg6WpxnRvcu0Iy3ZSoR26r5c1ku?usp=sharing), in which the cartoon episodes are grouped as described in the paper.
2. scene_metadata: directory where the metadata for all scenes are stored. One csv file per episodes, including all scenes within that episode.
3. raw_annotations: directory where the original annotations from the annotators are stored. One .xlsx file per episode. Each .xlsx file contains two datasheets: (1) the annotators' raw selections for each scene in the episode and (2) the reshaping process by us in order to calculate the inner-annotators agreement.
4. final_annotations: directory where the final probability labels for each scene are stored. One csv file per episode, in which each scene has a list of tuples as label. The tuples have format of (label, probability).
